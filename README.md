# GPS Clock

A GPS-synchronized digital clock based on the open-source [Arduino](https://arduino.cc) hardware platform.

## Overview

The COVID-19 lockdown rekindled a decades-long interest of mine in learning a bit more about electronics. Even though I was fascinated with the subject at a very early age, my interests gravitated towards software, and 40 years later, here I am clearing the cobwebs and delving into the study of electronics.

The best and most rewarding way to learn something new is to build something tangible and functional. This project is a culmination of my studies and hacking over a period of three months. It is a nontrival project in the sense that a variety of components are needed to build a digital clock that automatically sets the time and date based on GPS signals.

Bear with me if you happen to be a long-time Arduino hacker and developer, as this is my first serious project other than piecing things together with breadboards.

## Building

The [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.cc/pro/cli) is used for both compilation of source code and uploading of the binary to the actual board.
