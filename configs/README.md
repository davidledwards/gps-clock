# Clock Configurations

This folder contains predefined clock configurations. The full spectrum of configuration options can be found [here](../README.md).

The header files in this directory are generated by executing `make config` in the base directory of this project.

To use a predefined configuation, copy the file `.config-<zzz>` to the base directory and rename it to `.config`. When `make build` is executed, `config.h` is generated prior to compilation.

Example:

```shell
cp configs/.config-avr-nano-iso-metric-normal .config
make build
```
